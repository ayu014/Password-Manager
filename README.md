# Password Manager

A **Python-based Password Manager** that helps you store and manage your credentials (websites, emails, passwords) securely in a JSON file. This project includes functionality to generate strong passwords and copy them to your clipboard for easy access.

## Features

- **Add Credentials**: Store website, email, and password information in a JSON file.
- **Password Generation**: Generate strong, random passwords with a single click.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy generated passwords directly to your clipboard using the `pyperclip` library.
- **User-friendly GUI**: An easy-to-use interface built with `tkinter`.





## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- **Virtual Environment (recommended)**: It's best to run this project in a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
  
## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ayu014/Password-Manager.git
     cd Password-Manager
     ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   - Create the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Install all required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - Once everything is set up, run the main Python script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Adding a New Entry**:
   - Open the password manager, enter the website, email, and password details.
   - You can either generate a strong password using the "Generate Password" button or enter your own.
   - Click the "Add" button to save the credentials into the `data.json` file.

2. **Copy Password to Clipboard**:
   - After generating a password, it will automatically be copied to your clipboard, making it easy to paste into websites or applications.

3. **Generated Password**:
   - Passwords generated by the system are secure and complex, suitable for ensuring strong security for your accounts.

## File Security and Privacy

- **Sensitive Data**: The project stores credentials in plain text in a JSON file (`data.json`).
- **Ignored Files**: The following files are ignored by Git to protect sensitive information:
  ```txt
  data.json
  config.json
  ```

## Upcoming Features

- **Encryption of Stored Passwords**: Adding encryption to protect stored passwords from unauthorized access.
- **Search and Filter**: A search functionality to allow easy lookup of credentials by website or email.
- **Multi-user Support**: Support for managing passwords for multiple users with separate accounts.
